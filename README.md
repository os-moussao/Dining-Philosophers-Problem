## Understanding Threads and Processes
### Process:
A process is simply a program in execution
### Thread:
A thread is the unit of execution within a process. A process can have one or many threads (all executing a the same time).
### Process VS Thread:
- Time to terminate:
	A process takes more time to terminate\
	A thread takes less time
- Resources:
	A process consumes more resources \
	A thread consumes few resources
- Treatment by OS:
	Different processes are treated separately by OS\
	All peer threads are treated as a single task by OS\
- Memory & Sharing:
	Treads share memory and share data with each other\
	Processes are mostly isolated
